This directory contains the documentation for the version of the
restricted quantifier library created by Wai Wong in 1993.

For the kananaskis release, I've shrunk down the restricted
quantification library, since proof tools like the simplifier and
first-order prover have subsumed many of the lower-level tactics. I've
ported some of the old documentation to the help/Docfiles directory;
the rest remains here in case there's a demand for more of the old
functionality.

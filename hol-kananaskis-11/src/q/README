This is a small library intended to make the handling of quotations
somewhat more convenient, for some common HOL functions that use
quotations. This saves on some typing, both of the name of the HOL type
or term parser, and of type constraints.

To load the library:

   load "QLib";

This loads in a structure "Q", and the quotation-friendly entrypoints
are then accessible through the "dot" notation, e.g.,

   Q.EXISTS_TAC `x`

The full set of entrypoints, which is quite ad-hoc, can be found by
examining Q.sig.

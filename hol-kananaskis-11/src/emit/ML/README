This directory contains files generated by calls to EmitML.

Most of these come from the execution of ../basis_emitScript. If they
have to be regenerated, then that script needs to be run again. That
effect can be achieved by touching (in the sense of the Unix command),
../basis_emitScript.sml and then running Holmake. It would also be
possible to simply remove ../basis_emitTheory.sml before calling
Holmake.

The ARM/v4 example distributed with HOL also generates an ML file that
is deposited here. Dealing with the fact that it may or may not be
deposited, depending on how HOL is being built, explains the
complicated Holmakefile.

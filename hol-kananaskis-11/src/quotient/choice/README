This directory contains an alternative development of
the foundations of the higher order quotients library,
which attempts to avoid using the Axiom of Choice.

At the beginning of the development, the Hilbert epsilon
"indefinite choice" operator is used to define the iota
"definite choice" operator.  The only use of the epsilon
operator thereafter is in proving the function quotient
extension theorem.  That theorem is then used to prove the
existance of an operator satisfying the same behavioral axiom
as the Hilbert epsilon operator.

This is the development described in section 6 of the paper,
"A Design Structure for Higher Order Quotients,"
available at http://www.trustworthytools.com/id14.html.

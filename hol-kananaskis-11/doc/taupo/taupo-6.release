Taupo-6 is very similar to Taupo-5.  The reason for its release is to
address problems with building under Windows.  Taupo-5 would not build
under Windows with mosml2.00 (though it would succeed with
mosml1.44).  This release fixes that problem.

Bugs fixed:
-----------
  * The "known constants" behaviour advertised for Taupo-4 (see
    doc/taupo-4.release) wasn't properly implemented.  Now this
    behaviour is as described earlier.

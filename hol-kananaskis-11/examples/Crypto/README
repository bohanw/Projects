This directory provides a collection of block ciphers 

  * AES 
  * IDEA 
  * MARS 
  * RC6
  * Serpent 
  * TEA
  * TWOFISH

(and their functional correctness proofs), plus some modes 
of operation (modesScript.sml). Also the hash algorithm SHA-1
has been formalized. A worked example in data encryption may 
be found in tea.data.encrypt.

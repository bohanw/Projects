ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

HolBddLib would not have been possible without BuDDy from
Jorn Lind-Nielsen and MuDDy from Ken Friis Larsen and Jakob Lichtenberg.

This research was initially supported by EPSRC grant
GR/K57343 "Checking Equivalence Between Synthesised Logic and
Non-Synthesisable Behavioural Prototypes", EPSRC grant GR/L35973
entitled "A Hardware Compilation Workbench", EPSRC grant
GR/L74262 entitled "A uniform semantics for Verilog and VHDL
suitable for both simulation and formal verification" and ESPRIT
Framework IV LTR 26241 project Prosper "Proof and Specification
Assisted Design Environments". Currently the research is supported by
EPSRC grant GR/R27105/01 entitled "Fully Expansive Proof and
Algorithmic Verification" (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mjcg/HolCheck/).

At the beginning of the research, data from Atanas Parashkevov
and Bill Roscoe on the BDD and state space sizes arising from Peg Solitaire
was useful for evaluating and testing the first version of HolBddLib.

Michael Norrish and Konrad Slind have provided invaluable help with
HOL, which they are currently developing. 

Mark Aagaard provided some
of the information on Voss and its successors described in
the preface.

Paul Jackson, Jesper Moller and Konrad Slind provided detailed
comments and suggestions on a first draft of the University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory Technical Report No.481.

Our round-trip testing can be done here.

For now, we only go from ACL2 source file axioms.lisp to an ML
version.

We currently create two files in results/: an "essential" version of
ACL2 source file axioms.lisp, and the result of translating
gold/axioms.lisp to axioms.ml.  We tend to trust the translation to an
"essential" axioms.lisp.

Instructions for updating when ACL2 version changes:

When ACL2 is updated to a new version, first run doit.  Then check
quickly that results/axioms.lisp and gold/axioms.lisp are similar and
that gold/axioms.ml and results/axioms.ml (the latter generated from
gold/axioms.lisp) are identical.  This can perhaps be determined
easily by inspection of ./diffout.

diff gold/axioms.ml results/axioms.ml
# The above should produce no output, because results/axioms.ml was
# generated from gold/axioms.lisp.
cp -p results/axioms.lisp gold/
./doit
diff gold/axioms.lisp results/axioms.lisp
# The above should produce no output.
# Since axioms.ml was OK before, we figure that it's OK now as well:
cp -p results/axioms.ml gold/
# Now do final check, which should succeed:
./doit
# Then commit to svn (preferably stating the ACL2 version):
svn commit -m 'Updated for new ACL2 version'

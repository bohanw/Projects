Overview
--------

This directory is a preliminary slurping in of J Moore's M1 ACL2 JVM
model into HOL, tweaked manually to try to get it to build in HOL4
under Moscow ML and Poly/ML.

Holmake should perform the complete proof, including rebuilding the
HOL-ACL2 infrastructure. This will takes tens of minutes.

There is a rather arbitrary division of HOL functions operating on
s-expressions into those that are defined properly in HOL (using
acl2Define) and those that are axiomatically defined based on trusting
ACL2 (these are defined with acl2AxiomDefine). Ideally everything
should be properly defined, but I was too lazy to figure out the
termination proofs for ACL2::NONNEGATIVE-INTEGER-QUOTIENT and
COMMON-LISP::EXPT (see file hol_defaxiomsScript.sml). See the file
acl2/ISSUES for some more discussion.

To get a flavour of the M1 example in HOL, run hol in this directory,
load "M1Examples" and then look at M1Examples.Examples1 (some selected
examples) and M1Examples.Examples2 (shows all the theorems in
imported_acl2Theory).

A log of doing this (in Moscow ML) is in the file M1Examples.txt.

Notes:

 1. The HOL functions corresponding to the AC2 M1 JVM model are in
    imported_acl2Theory;

 2. The ML function acl2_simp performs some simplifications on
    imported ACL2.

 3. The ACL2 name "!" (i.e. factorial) is translated to "exclaim" in HOL.

This directory contains examples in various states of development. It
is intended primarily as a place where developers put their
experimental code. Some directories (e.g. acl2-hol-ltl-paper-example,
LTL, M1) are self-contained in that they have their own copies of all
the ACL2-HOL infrastructure (possibly tweaked for the purposes of the
particular example).

README ...................... This file				 
LTL ......................... Legacy directory for LTL example
M1 .......................... Importing J Moore's M1 JVM model into HOL 
acl2-hol-ltl-paper-example .. HOL proofs described in LTL paper
encap ....................... Stuff from Matt to test HOL support for ACL2 encapsulate
miller-rabin.sml ............ Miller-Rabin example 
example_axiomsScript.ml ..... Legacy file
pprint-example.lisp ......... Legacy example for testing pprint-file.csh
pprint-example.pp.lisp ...... Legacy example for testing pprint-file.csh
testEncode.sml .............. Legacy file


See ../tests/inputs/ for additional examples.  In particular, the file
summary.lisp includes an LTL example in ACL2 supplied by Sandip Ray;
each of the following files requires (via include-book) the one
underneath it.

   summary.lisp
   records.lisp
   apply-total-order.lisp
   total-order.lisp

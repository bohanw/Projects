op by : term quotation * tactic -> tactic

SYNOPSIS
Prove and place a theorem on the assumptions of the goal.

DESCRIBE
An invocation {tm by tac}, when applied to goal {A ?- g}, applies
{tac} to goal {A ?- tm}. If {tm} is thereby proved, it is added to
{A}, yielding the new goal {A,tm ?- g}. If {tm} is not proved by
{tac}, then any remaining subgoals generated are added to {A,tm ?- g}.

When {tm} is added to the existing assumptions {A}, it is
“stripped”, i.e., broken apart by eliminating existentials,
conjunctions, and disjunctions. This can lead to case splitting.

FAILURE
Fails if {tac} fails when applied to {A ?- tm}.

EXAMPLE
Given the goal {{x <= y, w < x} ?- P}, suppose that the fact
{?n. y = n + w} would help in eventually proving {P}. Invoking

   `?n. y = n + w` by (EXISTS_TAC ``y-w`` THEN DECIDE_TAC)

yields the goal {{y = n + w, x <= y, w < x} ?- P} in which the proved
fact has been added to the assumptions after its existential
quantifier is eliminated. Note the parentheses around the tactic: this
is needed for the example because {by} binds more tightly than {THEN}.

Since the tactic supplied need not solve the generated subgoal, {by}
gives a useful way of generating proof obligations while pursuing a
particular line of reasoning. For example, the above goal could also
be attacked by

   `?n. y = n + w` by ALL_TAC

with the result being the goal {{x <= y, w < x} ?- ?n. y = n + w} and
the augmented original {{y = n + w, x <= y, w < x} ?- P}. Now either
may be attempted.

COMMENTS
Use of {by} can be more convenient than {IMP_RES_TAC} and {RES_TAC}
when they would generate many useless assumptions.

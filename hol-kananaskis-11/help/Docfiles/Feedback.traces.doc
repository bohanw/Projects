\BLTYPE
traces : unit -> {name : string, current_value : int,
                  default_value : int, maximum : int} list
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of registered tracing variables.

\KEYWORDS
Tracing.

\DESCRIBE
The function {traces} is part of the interface to a collection of
variables that control the verboseness of various tools within the
system. Tracing can be useful both when debugging proofs (with the
simplifier for example), and also as a guide to how an automatic proof
is proceeding (with {mesonLib} for example).

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
- traces();
> val it =
    [{default = 10, name = "Subgoal number", trace_level = 10},
     {default = 0, name = "Rewrite", trace_level = 0},
     {default = 0, name = "Ho_Rewrite", trace_level = 0}]
}

irule : thm_tactic

SYNOPSIS
Reduces the goal using a supplied implication, with matching.

KEYWORDS
tactic, modus ponens, implication.

DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem of the form

   A' |- !x1...xn. s ==> !y1...ym. t ==> !z1...zk. u

{irule} produces a tactic that reduces a goal whose conclusion {u'} is
a substitution and/or type instance of {u} to the corresponding
instances of {s} and of {t}. Any variables free in {s} or {t} but not
in {u} will be existentially quantified in the resulting subgoal, and
a variable free in both {s} and {t} will result in a subgoal which is
{s /\ t}, existentially quantified

The following diagram is simplified: more implications and quantified
variables than shown are allowed.

     A ?- u'
  =========================  irule (A' |- !x. s ==> !y. t ==> u)
   A ?- ?z. s'   A ?- ?w. t'

where {z} and {w} are (type instances of) variables among {x}, {y}
that do not occur free in {s}, {t}. The assumptions {A'},
instantiated, are added as further new subgoals.

FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem, when stripped of universal quantification and
antecedents of implications, can be instantiated to match the goal.

COMMENTS
The supplied theorem is pre-processed using {SPEC_UNDISCH_EXL}, which
removes the universal quantifiers and antecedents of implications, and
applies {EXISTS_LEFT} which existentially quantifies variables which
were instantiated but appeared only in the antecedents of
implications. See {SPEC_UNDISCH_EXL} for details.

Then {prim_irule} is applied. To avoid this preprocessing just use
{prim_irule}.

The order of the new subgoals depends on the order in which the hypotheses of
the pre-processed theorem (before the substitution) are stored.
See {prim_irule}.

EXAMPLE
With goal {R a (f b)} and theorem {thm} being

   |- !x u. P u x ==> !y. Q w x y ==> R x (f y)

the proof step {e (irule thm)} gives new goals {Q w a b} and
{?u. P u a}.

With goal {a = b} and theorem {trans}

   |- !x y. (x = y) ==> !z. (y = z) ==> (x = z)

the proof step {e (irule trans)} gives new goal

   ?y. (a = y) /\ (y = b)

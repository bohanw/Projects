\LIBRARY

\STRUCTURE

\DESCRIBE
{AP_TERM_TAC} reduces a goal of the form {A ?- f x = f y} by stripping away
the function applications, giving the new goal {A ?- x = y}.
{
    A ?- f x = f y
   ================  AP_TERM_TAC
     A ?- x = y
}


\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal is equational, with both sides being applications
of the same function.

Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC : term quotation -> tactic

SYNOPSIS
Introduces abbreviations by matching a pattern against the goal statement.

DESCRIBE
When applied to the goal {(asl, w)}, the tactic {Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC q}
parses the quotation {q} in the context of the goal, producing a term
to use as a pattern.  The tactic then attempts a (first order) match
of the pattern against the term {w}.  Variables that occur in both the
pattern and the goal are treated as “local constants”, and will not
acquire instantiations.

For each variable {v} in the pattern that has not been treated as a
local constant, there will be an instantiation term {t}, such that the
substitution pattern {[v1 |-> t1, v2 |-> t2, ...]} produces {w}.  The
effect of the tactic is to then perform abbreviations in the goal,
replacing each {t} with the corresponding {v}, and adding assumptions
of the form {Abbrev(v = t)} to the goal.

FAILURE
{MATCH_ABBREV_TAC} fails if the pattern provided does not match the
goal, or if variables from the goal are used in the pattern in ways
that make the pattern fail to type-check.

EXAMPLE
If the current goal is

   ?- (n + 10) * y <= 42315 /\ (!x y. x < y ==> f x < f y)

then applying the tactic {Q.MATCH_ABBREV_TAC `X <= Y /\ P`} results in
the goal

   Abbrev(X = (n + 10) * y),
   Abbrev(Y = 42315),
   Abbrev(P = !x y. x < y ==> f x < f y)
      ?-
   X <= Y /\ P

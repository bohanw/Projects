To convert a verilog file to blif, follow these steps:
-> Run ./verilog2blif <benchmark-name> inside top directory
    Example: 
        cd HW6/
        ./verilog2blif diagonal

A blif file would be created in top directory with name <benchmark-name>.blif
If you are planning to run verilog2blif in some other path, remember to make changes to .fconfig file appropriately.
